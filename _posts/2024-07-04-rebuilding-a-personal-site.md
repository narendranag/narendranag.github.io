It's been twenty-five years since I published my first personal site. That first attempt can still be found in the internet archive, and the braver amongst you can go have a look. 

After spending time on Blogger, Medium and multiple false starts over the year, I finally decided it's time to do this properly, once and for all.

Here's my stack:

I'm hosting this on Github Pages
I've got Jekyll up and running to generate the site
And I've going to spend time with Claude and ChatGPT figuring out how to find and pull in the stuff I've published over the years into this one place. 

So, that's that. For now.
