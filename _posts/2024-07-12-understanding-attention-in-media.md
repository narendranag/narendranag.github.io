The only truly finite asset is human attention — to be able to capture it is the single most important objective for both publishers and brands.

For publishers, producing content that has a user's attention is the key to monetization — whether via subscriptions, advertising or both.

For brands, accessing that attention and holding on to it via an ad and message that stays with a user is the key to success.

Given this, I think understanding how attention works is critically important and, I must admit, this has informed much of my thinking (and work) over the years.

These three cognitive models have always provided a framework for my understanding of how attention works, particularly in environments rich with sensory information like mass media. 

Broadbent's model emphasizes the selective nature of attention, Treisman's theory highlights the attenuation of unattended information, and Kahneman's capacity model underscores the limitations of cognitive resources. Together, they explain how and why certain media content captures and holds attention, and how multitasking impacts information processing.

## Cognitive Theories and Models

### 1. Broadbent's Filter Model

**Overview**:
Broadbent's Filter Model, also known as the "early selection model," was one of the first theories to explain how attention functions in the human brain. Proposed by Donald Broadbent in 1958, this model suggests that attention operates like a filter that processes information selectively.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Filter Mechanism**: According to Broadbent, we receive a plethora of sensory information, but we can only process a limited amount of it at any given time. The filter mechanism selects the most important information based on physical characteristics like tone, pitch, or loudness.
- **Bottleneck Theory**: This model posits that there's a bottleneck in the information processing system. Only information that passes through the filter goes on for further processing in the brain, while the rest is discarded.

**Application in Media**:
- **Advertisements**: In the context of media, advertisements use prominent features (e.g., loud sounds, bright colors) to pass through the attention filter and capture audience interest. For example, a TV commercial might use a catchy jingle or a visually striking image to ensure it gets noticed.
- **Message Salience**: Important or novel messages are designed to stand out from the background noise, ensuring they pass through the filter and are processed by the audience.

### 2. Treisman's Attenuation Theory

**Overview**:
Proposed by Anne Treisman in 1964, Treisman's Attenuation Theory is a modification of Broadbent's model. Treisman suggested that instead of a strict filter, attention works more like a volume control that attenuates or weakens the unattended information rather than completely blocking it.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Attenuator**: The attenuator reduces the strength of the unattended signals, making them less likely to be processed, but not completely excluding them from attention.
- **Thresholds**: Certain stimuli, such as one's own name or other personally relevant information, have lower thresholds and can be detected even when attenuated.

**Application in Media**:
- **Background Information**: This theory explains why viewers can follow a secondary storyline in a TV show while focusing on the main plot. The secondary information is attenuated but still partially processed.
- **Multitasking**: People can partially attend to background media, like a radio playing while working, because the unattended information is not completely blocked out.

### 3. Kahneman's Capacity Model

**Overview**:
Daniel Kahneman's Capacity Model, presented in his 1973 book "Attention and Effort," views attention as a resource with a limited capacity. This model is particularly useful for understanding how attention is distributed among different tasks.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Limited Capacity**: Attention is a finite resource that can be allocated to various tasks. When multiple tasks are attended to simultaneously, the cognitive resources are divided among them.
- **Arousal and Effort**: The model incorporates the role of arousal in determining the amount of mental effort that can be deployed. Higher arousal levels can increase the capacity for attention, up to an optimal point.

**Application in Media**:
- **Media Multitasking**: When individuals engage in media multitasking, such as watching TV while scrolling through social media, the cognitive load is shared between the tasks, often leading to decreased performance and retention for each task.
- **Task Prioritization**: Media producers can design content to capture the primary focus of the audience, understanding that secondary tasks (like background music) will receive less attention.
