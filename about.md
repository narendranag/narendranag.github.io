## About Narendra

For the last twenty-five years, Narendra has combined story-telling ability, technical knowledge and strategic thinking to deliver impact in the many roles he has had.

In his current role as Chief Strategy Officer at APMC Inc.; Narendra is helping build the future of the media industry — addressing both the commercial and technical challenges of the transition from cable to streaming. 

As founder of Laminar, he successfully built a technology platform that is the shopify of the streaming safe, enabling media companies to launch a global, full-featured, completely customizable streaming service in a matter of weeks. Laminar was acquired by APMC in December 2023.

As Chief Digital Officer at Xynteo — Narendra led a digital transformation effort at a mission driven firm that works with executive leadership at some of the world’s largest companies (Unilever, Shell, Mastercard etc).

Prior to this, Narendra spent six years at Publicis Groupe, using data driven insights to build breakthrough end-to-end digital programs: from influence to commerce, leveraging earned, owned and paid channels. 

Acqui-hired to build a digital team in India, he went on to build multi-cultural, multi-country teams at the Asia level to serve global and regional clients. 

This was after spending 9 years as a journalist, across television (CNN-IBN) and print (Mint-Wall Street Journal), and being part of the launch team of two television channels.

He has always been passionate about the power of computing and the imagination of science fiction, and is driven by the need to make a real dent in the world.
